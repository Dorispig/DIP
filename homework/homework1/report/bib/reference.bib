abstract = {We provide an image deformation method based on Moving Least Squares using various classes of linear functions including affine, similarity and rigid transformations. These deformations are realistic and give the user the impression of manipulating real-world objects. We also allow the user to specify the deformations using either sets of points or line segments, the later useful for controlling curves and profiles present in the image. For each of these techniques, we provide simple closed-form solutions that yield fast deformations, which can be performed in real-time.},

abstract = {The human face is an elastic object. A natural paradigm for representing facial expressions is to form a complete 3D model of facial muscles and tissues. However, determining the actual parameter values for synthesizing and animating facial expressions is tedious; evaluating these parameters for facial expression analysis out of gray-level images is ahead of the state of the art in computer vision. Using only 2D face images and a small number of anchor points, we show that the method of radial basis functions provides a powerful mechanism for processing facial expressions. Although constructed specifically for facial expressions, our method is applicable to other elastic objects as well.}
